# 📊 Sales Performance Dashboard (Excel Data Analytics Project)

## About This Project

This is my first Excel-based data analytics project where I created an interactive **Sales Performance Dashboard** to analyze employee performance across different regions.

The main purpose of this project was to practice real-world Excel analytics concepts like Pivot Tables, slicers, charts, and data analysis — not just formulas.

Using this dashboard, anyone can quickly understand:

- Top 5 performing employees  
- Bottom 5 performing employees  
- Total sales by employee  
- Target Hit Percentage (%)  
- Region-wise performance using slicers  

All visuals update dynamically when a region is selected.

## What This Dashboard Shows

### 🔹 Top 5 Employees

Displays employees with the highest sales and best target achievement.

Helps answer:
- Who is performing the best?
- Who is contributing the most to sales?

---

### 🔹 Bottom 5 Employees

Highlights lowest performers based on sales and target hit %.

Useful for:
- Identifying improvement areas  
- Understanding low performance patterns  

---

### 🔹 Region Selection (Slicer)

You can filter data by regions such as:

- Chennai  
- Delhi  
- Mumbai  
- Nagpur  
- Surat  

The dashboard refreshes automatically without any manual updates.
