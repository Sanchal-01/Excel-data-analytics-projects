# Retail Sales Performance Dashboard

## About This Project

This is my second Excel data analytics project where I worked on a retail sales dataset and built an interactive dashboard after performing data cleaning and preparation.

The project focuses on understanding sales trends, profit distribution, customer behavior, and regional performance using Excel analytics tools.
